    <h1>Air Fryer Broiled Grapefruit</h1>
    <p>This warm and juicy grapefruit with a buttery sweet topping is the perfect accompaniment to your Sunday brunch and also makes a lovely dessert or snack. I like to add a pinch of sea salt at the end to really bring out the flavors.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 red grapefruit, refrigerated</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon softened butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>aluminum foil</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>


        </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut grapefruit in half crosswise and slice off a thin sliver off the bottom of each half if the fruit isn't sitting flat. Use a sharp paring knife to cut around the outside edge of the grapefruit and between each segment to make the fruit easier to eat once cooked.</li>
            <li>Combine softened butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar in a small bowl. Spread mixture over each grapefruit half. Sprinkle with remaining brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Cut aluminum foil into two 5-inch squares and place each grapefruit half on one square; fold up the edges to catch any juices. Set in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Broil in the air fryer until sugar mixture is bubbling, 6 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle fruit with cinnamon before serving.</li>
